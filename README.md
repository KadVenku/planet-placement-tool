# Planet Placement Tool
In desperate need of a planet placement tool for YVaW this is the attempt to create a useful and intuitive tool, which once finished will be released for the community to use.

## Features
### V1.0
- [x] Free scaling galaxy map.
    - [x] freely scale the positions of the planets you've placed to toy around with spacing and battle overlapping planet mouse events.
    - [x] User defined background source image.
- [ ] Place as many planets as you want. (The tool will notify you once you hit the limits of the engine).
- [x] Export the planet positions to a file.
- [x] Save the progress you've made in a project file and reload it from disk.
